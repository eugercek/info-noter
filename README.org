* Workflow
I always take note with respect to the content I read.
For example If I'm reading a book you can see all chapters' name in my org-mode notes.
One of the biggest problem is just this 7 command :(

1. =yy= Copy Line
2. =SPC w l= Go to notes buffer
3. =p= Paste
4. Handle extra ====================
5. =SPC *= My personal binding for =org-ctrl-start=
6. =O= for go to new line
7. =SPC w h= for =Info-mode= buffer
